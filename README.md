- 👋 Hi, I’m @MaCelle0x1
- 👀 I’m interested in all things cybersecurity. I prefer the red team side of things, but I am open to learning anything new. Particularly focused on web application security as of right now. 
- 🌱 I’m currently majoring in Information Systems Security as a Junior. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on CTF events or just HackTheBox machines in general.
